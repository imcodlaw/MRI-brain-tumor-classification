# MRI-brain-tumor-classification

A brain tumor is one of the most dangerous diseases that attack the brain and nervous system. There are several types of brain tumor, i.e. meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumor. The detection of brain tumors has to be done as soon as possible due to the confidential medical treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the medical tools for detecting brain tumors by scanning the head area of the patients. The medical image produced by MRI should be classified manually which is very subjective and error-prone. This study tries to classify the brain tumor with a machine learning approach in order to give an automatic and objective brain tumor classification. The Convolutional Neural Network using GoogLeNet architecture will be employed since it is a parsimonious architect with strong performance among the previous methods. Finally, this study had succeeded to classify the brain tumor with 95.39% accuracy and 0.378 value of the loss.
